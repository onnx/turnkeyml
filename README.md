We are on a mission to make it easy to use the most important tools in the ONNX ecosystem. TurnkeyML accomplishes this by providing a full SDK for LLMs with the Lemonade SDK, as well as a no-code CLIs for general ONNX workflows with `turnkey`.

## üçã Lemonade SDK: Quickly serve, benchmark and deploy LLMs

# The Lemonade SDK Project has moved to: https://github.com/lemonade-sdk/lemonade

## The new PyPI package name is `lemonade-sdk`

## The new Lemonade_Server_Installer.exe is at: https://github.com/lemonade-sdk/lemonade/releases

## Please migrate to the new repository and package as soon as possible.

For example:
```
    pip uninstall turnkeyml
    pip install lemonade-sdk[YOUR_EXTRAS]
    e.g., pip install lemonade-sdk[llm-oga-hybrid]
```

## Thank you for using Lemonade SDK!

## üîë Turnkey: A Complementary Tool for ONNX Workflows

While Lemonade focuses on LLMs, [Turnkey](https://github.com/onnx/turnkeyml/blob/main/docs/turnkey/README.md) is a no-code CLI designed for general ONNX workflows, such as exporting and optimizing CNNs and Transformers.

To see the list of supported tools, using the following command:

```bash
turnkey -h
```
