    Tool that loads a build from a previous usage of TurnkeyML and passes
    its saved State on to the next tool in the sequence.

    Works best with build State that is complete on disk.

    For example:
    - State that references an ONNX file is a good target, because the ONNX file can
        be loaded from disk.
    - State that references a PyTorch model in memory is a poor target, because
        that PyTorch model will not be available when the State file is loaded
        from disk.

    Expected inputs:
    - Input file is a *_state.yaml file in a turnkey cache build directory

    Outputs:
     - State has the contents of the state.yaml file of the target build.
