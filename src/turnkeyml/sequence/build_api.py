    """Use build a model instance into an optimized ONNX file.

    Args:
        sequence: the build tools and their arguments used to build the model.
        model: Model to be mapped to an optimized ONNX file, which can be a PyTorch
            model instance or a path to an ONNX file.
        inputs: Example inputs to the user's model. The ONNX file will be
            built to handle inputs with the same static shape only.
        build_name: Unique name for the model that will be
            used to store the ONNX file and build state on disk. Defaults to the
            name of the file that calls build_model().
        cache_dir: Directory to use as the cache for this build. Output files
            from this build will be stored at cache_dir/build_name/
            Defaults to the current working directory, but we recommend setting it to
            an absolute path of your choosing.
        monitor: Display a monitor on the command line that
            tracks the progress of this function as it builds the ONNX file.
        rebuild: determines whether to rebuild or load a cached build. Options:
            - "if_needed" (default): overwrite invalid cached builds with a rebuild
            - "always": overwrite valid cached builds with a rebuild
            - "never": load cached builds without checking validity, with no guarantee
                of functionality or correctness
            - None: Falls back to default
        lean_cache: delete build artifacts after the build has completed.
