    """
    The State class is meant to carry build state, starting with the user's
    initial arguments, through each build Tool in the Sequence, and finally
    to the disk, where it is used to assess cache hits.

    State is initialized with the key members that are shared by every build,
    and reasonable default values are assigned as appropriate.

    Tool developers can also add any members they wish. To get or set an
    attribute, reference it as an attribute:
        1. get: `my_variable = state.attribute_name`
        2. set: `state.attribute_name = my_variable`

    Build State can be saved and loaded from disk in the form of a state.yaml file
    via State.save() and load_state(), respectively. Note that while State can
    contain members of any type, only YAML-safe members (str, int, bool, float,
    list, dict, tuple) will be saved and loaded.
