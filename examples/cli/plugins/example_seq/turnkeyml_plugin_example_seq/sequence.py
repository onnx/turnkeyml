"""
This script is an example of a sequence.py file for Sequence Plugin. Such a sequence.py 
can be used to redefine the build phase of the turnkey CLI, benchmark_files(),
and build_model() to have any custom behavior.

In this example sequence.py file we are setting the build sequence to simply
export from pytorch to ONNX. This differs from the default build sequence, which
exports to ONNX, optimizes, and converts to float16.

After you install the plugin, you can tell `turnkey` to use this sequence with:
