# Tool Examples

This directory contains examples to help you learn how to use the tools. The examples are split up into two sub-directories:
1. `examples/cli`: a tutorial series for the `turnkey` CLI. This is the recommended starting point.
1. `examples/api`: scripts that demonstrate how to use the `turnkey.evaluate_files()` API.
1. `examples/llm`: scripts that demonstrate the `lemonade` CLI for LLMs.
