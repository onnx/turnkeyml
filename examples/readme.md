# Tool Examples

This directory contains examples to help you learn how to use the tools. The examples are split up into these sub-directories:
1. `examples/lemonade`: scripts that demonstrate the `lemonade` CLI for LLMs.
1. `examples/turnkey/cli`: a tutorial series for the `turnkey` CLI. This is the recommended starting point.
1. `examples/turnkey/api`: scripts that demonstrate how to use the `turnkey.files_api.evaluate_files()` API.
