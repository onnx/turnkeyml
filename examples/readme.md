# Tool Examples

This directory contains examples to help you learn how to use the tools. The examples are split up into two sub-directories:
1. `examples/cli`: a tutorial series for the `turnkey` CLI. This is the recommended starting point.
1. `examples/files_api`: scripts that demonstrate how to use the `turnkey.benchmark_files()` API.
1. `examples/build_api`: scripts that demonstrate how to use the `turnkey.build_model()` API.
