"""
This example demonstrates how to use the lemonade API to load a model for
inference on CPU using the hf-cpu recipe, and then use a thread to
generate a streaming the response to a prompt.

Note: this approach only works with recipes that support TextIteratorStreamer,
i.e., huggingface-based recipes such as hf-cpu and hf-dgpu.
