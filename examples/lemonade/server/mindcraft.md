# Mindcraft

## Overview

Mindcraft is an open-source project that creates Minecraft bots powered by large language models (LLMs) to engage with the game and its players. This readme will demonstrate how to integrate Lemonade to use local LLMs with Mindcraft.

## Expectations

We found the `Qwen-1.5-7B-Chat-Hybrid` model to be the most effective for this task, delivering fast responses with higher accuracy. However, as a smaller model running locally, with a limited context length, it may occasionally struggle with certain requests—for instance, it might attempt to build a structure, but the result may not be correct. For more detailed information, please refer to the [Data Insights](#-data-insights) section.

## Setup

### Environment Setup
1. Clone [Mindcraft](https://github.com/kolbytn/mindcraft) from GitHub: 
  - `git checkout 07ea071ac3b0d4954d62b09d881c38a06bc2a589` - this will ensure the code base is equal to where this test was performed
1. Obtain a copy of [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us) from Microsoft. 1.20.4 of the JAVA Edition is required for this. You can obtain that version [by following these instructions](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-java-edition-1-20-4).
1. Install Lemonade Server using the following [installation instructions](https://ryzenai.docs.amd.com/en/latest/llm/server_interface.html#server-setup).
1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (at least v14)
1. In the clone of the `mindcraft` repository:
    1. Rename the file `keys.example.json` to `keys.json`. You do not need to edit the contents of this JSON file.
    1. Update `keys.json` by adding any text to the value of `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
       ```json
        {
            "OPENAI_API_KEY": "<put any text here>",
            "OPENAI_ORG_ID": "",
            "GEMINI_API_KEY": "",
            "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": "",
            "REPLICATE_API_KEY": "",
            "GROQCLOUD_API_KEY": "",
            "HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY": "",
            "QWEN_API_KEY": "",
            "XAI_API_KEY": "",
            "MISTRAL_API_KEY": "",
            "DEEPSEEK_API_KEY": "",
            "NOVITA_API_KEY": "",
            "OPENROUTER_API_KEY": ""
        }

       ```
    1. In a terminal/command prompt, run `npm install` from the cloned Mindcraft directory.
    1. Replace the contents of the file `andy.json` with the following:
        ```json
        {
            "name": "Andy",
            "model": {
                "model": "Qwen-1.5-7B-Chat-Hybrid",
                "url": "http://localhost:8000/api/v0",
                "params": {
                    "temperature": 0.5
                }
            },
            "modes": {
                "self_preservation": true,
                "unstuck": true,
                "cowardice": false,
                "self_defense": true,
                "hunting": true,
                "item_collecting": true,
                "torch_placing": true,
                "elbow_room": true,
                "idle_staring": true,
                "cheat": true
            }
        }
        ```
    1. Find the line in `src/models/prompter.js` that says:
        ```javascript
        else if (profile.model.includes('gpt') || profile.model.includes('o1')|| profile.model.includes('o3'))
        ```

        ... and replace it with the following:

        ```javascript
        else if ([
            'Qwen-1.5-7B-Chat-Hybrid',
            'Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-Hybrid'
        ].includes(profile.model) || profile.model.includes('gpt') || profile.model.includes('o1') || profile.model.includes('o3'))
        ```
1. Start Lemonade Server by double-clicking the desktop icon.
1. Start a Minecraft world and open it to LAN on localhost port 55916. This is done by pressing the ESC button to open the menu, then click "Open to LAN" and enter the Port Number: `55916`. Click "Start LAN World".
For instructions on how Open to LAN, see the section "Hosting a LAN Server" for the JAVA Edition in this [wiki article](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Tutorial:Setting_up_a_LAN_world).
1. Run `node main.js` from the installed directory
1. In Minecraft
    1. To give the agent commands, press `t` and enter the command. For example:
        - "come here"
        - "hunt pigs" - you and the agent must be close to some pigs to do this.

### Model Configurations
- Lemonade models tested:
  - Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-Hybrid
  - **Qwen-1.5-7B-Chat-Hybrid 👍**

## Challenges and Observations

1. The current MindCraft configuration has a tendency to send very large context that is resent. The context will include examples of behaviors that may not be necessary, generating over 2100 input tokens for simple commands. Further testing would be required to understand model behavior based on reduced context size.
1. Frequent token limit breaches resulting in timeouts or incomplete responses due to the aforementioned context size problem. Once the token maximum content ceiling is raised, further testing would be prudent using the same `Qwen-1.5-7B-Chat-Hybrid` model as a baseline and using it to test other models such as DeepSeek and Llama variants.
content
1. High GPU resource consumption during model inference, impacting system performance.
## Results


The `Qwen-1.5-7B-Chat-Hybrid` model showed the most potential, responding to commands and attempting construction tasks, though with limited accuracy.

## Recommendations

1. Optimize examples sent to Lemonade for conciseness to reduce token usage.
1. Reduce input context to prevent model overload.

## Data Insights

The following are examples of requests made by the Mindcraft software to the Lemonade Server and how the tokens were interpreted. These examples are taken from an initial game stage, including the first request sent to the Lemonade Server and a subsequent user chat that says, "come here." The purpose is to show how large the context is that is being sent. This could be optimized for more efficient performance and results.

Act human-like as if you were a typical Minecraft player, rather than an AI. Be very brief in your responses, don't apologize constantly, don't give instructions or make lists unless asked, and don't refuse requests. Don't pretend to act, use commands immediately when requested. Do NOT say this: 'Sure, I've stopped.', instead say this: 'Sure, I'll stop. !stop'. Do NOT say this: 'On my way! Give me a moment.', instead say this: 'On my way! !goToPlayer('playername', 3)'.
