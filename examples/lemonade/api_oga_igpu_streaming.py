"""
This example demonstrates how to use the lemonade API to load a model for
inference on integrated GPUs (iGPUs) via OnnxRuntime-GenAI using the oga-igpu recipe,
and then use a thread to generate a streaming the response to a prompt.

Note: this approach only works with recipes that support lemonade's OrtGenaiStreamer,
i.e., OGA-based recipes such as oga-cpu, oga-igpu, oga-npu, and oga-hybrid.

Make sure you have set up your OGA device in your Python environment.
See for details:
