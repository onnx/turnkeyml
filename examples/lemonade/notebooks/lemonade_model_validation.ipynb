    "## Lemonade Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Lemonade (LLM-Aide) is a software development kit (SDK) that expedites measurement, validation, and deployment of LLMs. It primarily supports OnnxRuntime-GenAI (OGA)-based LLMs but also provides support for llama.cpp and Hugging Face PyTorch LLMs as performance and accuracy baselines.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will focus on measurement and validation tasks, using the `lemonade` command line interface (CLI).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Command Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "The `lemonade` CLI uses a unique command syntax that enables convenient interoperability between models, frameworks, devices, accuracy tests, and deployment options.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each unit of functionality (e.g., loading a model, running a test, deploying a server, etc.) is called a `Tool`, and a single call to `lemonade` can invoke any number of `Tools`. Each `Tool` will perform its functionality, then pass its state to the next `Tool` in the command.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read each command out loud to understand what it is doing. For example, a command like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "lemonade -i microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct oga-load --device igpu --dtype int4 llm-prompt -p \"Hello, my thoughts are\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Can be read like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Run `lemonade` on the input `(-i)` checkpoint `microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct`. First, load it in the OnnxRuntime GenAI framework (`oga-load`), onto the integrated GPU device (`--device igpu`) in the int4 data type (`--dtype int4`). Then, pass the OGA model to the prompting tool (`llm-prompt`) with the prompt (`-p`) \"Hello, my thoughts are\" and print the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `lemonade -h` command will show you which options and Tools are available, and `lemonade TOOL -h` will tell you more about that specific Tool."

    "\n",

    "1. `oga-load`: load an OGA LLM into memory.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### `oga-bench` Configuration\n",

    "- `input_sequence_lengths`: list of input sizes to the model. Performance data will be collected for each item in the list.\n",
    "- `output_sequence_length`: number of output tokens to produce during generation.\n",
    "- `iterations`: how many times to repeat the experiment. Higher values take longer to run, but produce a more accurate result.\n",
    "- `warmup-iterations`: iterations that are not counted towards the experimental data. Used to warm up the system, such as the cache.\n",
