# Lemonade Server Spec

The `lemonade` SDK provides a standards-compliant server process that provides a REST API to enable communication with other applications. Right now, the [key endpoints of the OpenAI API](#openai-compatible-endpoints) are available. Our plan is to add more OpenAI endpoints, as well as Ollama-compatible endpoints, in the near future.

We are also actively investigating and developing [additional endpoints](#additional-endpoints) that will improve the experience of local applications.

## Endpoints Overview

### OpenAI-Compatible Endpoints
- POST `/api/v0/chat/completions` - Chat Completions (messages -> completion)
- POST `/api/v0/completions` - Text Completions (prompt -> completion)
- GET `/api/v0/models` - List available models

### Additional Endpoints

> ðŸš§ These additional endpoints are a preview that is under active development. The API specification is subject to change.

These additional endpoints were inspired by the [LM Studio REST API](https://lmstudio.ai/docs/api-reference/rest-api), [Ollama API](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/api.md), and [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction).

They focus on enabling client applications by extending existing cloud-focused APIs (e.g., OpenAI) to also include the ability to load and unload models before completion requests are made. These extensions allow for a greater degree of UI/UX responsiveness in native applications by allowing applications to:
- Pre-load models at UI-loading-time, as opposed to completion-request time.
- Load models from the local system that were downloaded by other applications (i.e., a common system-wide models cache). 
- Unload models to save memory space.

The additional endpoints under development are:
- POST `/api/v0/load` - Load a model
- POST `/api/v0/unload` - Unload a model
- POST `/api/v0/params` - Set generation parameters
- GET `/api/v0/health` - Check server health
- GET `/api/v0/stats` - Performance statistics from the last request

> ðŸš§ We are in the process of developing this interface. Let us know what's important to you on Github or by email (turnkeyml at amd dot com).

## Start the REST API Server

> **NOTE:** This server is intended for use on local systems only. Do not expose the server port to the open internet.

### Windows Installer

See the [Lemonade_Server_Installer.exe instructions](lemonade_server_exe.md) to get started. 

### Python Environment

If you have `lemonade` [installed in a Python environment](getting_started.md#from-pypi), simply activate it and run the following command to start the server:

```bash
lemonade serve
```

|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `model` | Yes | HuggingFace checkpoint to load. |
| `device` | No | Device to load the model on. Defaults to `hybrid`. |
| `cache_dir` | No | Parent directory where models are stored. Defaults to `~/.cache/lemonade`. |

#### Example request

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v0/load \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "<CHECKPOINT>",
    "cache_dir": "/Users/your_username/models"
  }'
```

#### Response format

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Model loaded successfully"
}
```

### `POST /api/v0/unload` <sub>![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-fully_available-green)</sub>

Explicitly unload a model. This is useful to free up memory and disk space while still leaving the server runnning (which takes minimal resources but a few seconds to start).

#### Parameters

This endpoint does not take any parameters.

#### Example request

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v0/unload
```

#### Response format

```json
{
  "status": "success",

### `POST /api/v0/params` <sub>![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-in_development-yellow)</sub>
Set the generation parameters for text completion. These parameters will persist across requests until changed.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `temperature` | No | Controls randomness in the output. Higher values (e.g. 0.8) make the output more random, lower values (e.g. 0.2) make it more focused and deterministic. Defaults to 0.7. |
| `top_p` | No | Controls diversity via nucleus sampling. Keeps the cumulative probability of tokens above this value. Defaults to 0.95. |
| `top_k` | No | Controls diversity by limiting to the k most likely next tokens. Defaults to 50. |
| `min_length` | No | The minimum length of the generated text in tokens. Defaults to 0. |
| `max_length` | No | The maximum length of the generated text in tokens. Defaults to 2048. |
| `do_sample` | No | Whether to use sampling (true) or greedy decoding (false). Defaults to true. |

#### Example request

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v0/params \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "temperature": 0.8,
    "top_p": 0.95,
    "max_length": 1000
  }'
```

#### Response format

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Generation parameters set successfully",
  "params": {
    "temperature": 0.8,
    "top_p": 0.95,
    "top_k": 40,
    "min_length": 0,
    "max_length": 1000,
    "do_sample": true

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v0/health
```

#### Response format

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "model_loaded": "<CHECKPOINT>"
}
```
### `GET /api/v0/stats` <sub>![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-fully_available-green)</sub>

{
  "time_to_first_token": 2.14,
  "tokens_per_second": 33.33,
  "input_tokens": 128,
  "output_tokens": 5,
  "decode_token_times": [0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05]
}
```

# Debugging

To help debug the Lemonade server, you can use the `--log-level` parameter to control the verbosity of logging information. The server supports multiple logging levels that provide increasing amounts of detail about server operations.

```
lemonade serve --log-level [level]
```

Where `[level]` can be one of:

- **critical**: Only critical errors that prevent server operation.
- **error**: Error conditions that might allow continued operation.
- **warning**: Warning conditions that should be addressed.
- **info**: (Default) General informational messages about server operation.
- **debug**: Detailed diagnostic information for troubleshooting, including metrics such as input/output token counts, Time To First Token (TTFT), and Tokens Per Second (TPS).
- **trace**: Very detailed tracing information, including everything from debug level plus all input prompts.
